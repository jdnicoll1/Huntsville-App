Huntsville, Texas was founded in 1836 when Pleasant and Ephraim Gray 
opened a trading post on the land. Ephraim Gray later became the first 
postmaster in 1837, naming it after his hometown of Huntsville, Alabama.
Huntsville later became known as the home of Sam Houston (pictured). 
Houston served as the President of the Republic of Texas, Governor of 
Texas, and in the United States Senate, just to name a few of his positions. He led the Texas Army in the Battle of San Jacinto, 
which became known as the decisive victory of the Texas Revolution. He has been 
noted for his life among the Cherokees of Tennessee, and -near the end of his life-
for his opposition to the American Civil War, a very unpopular position in his day.
